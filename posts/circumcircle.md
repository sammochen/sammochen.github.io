### how to use
drag the three points around and see the circle that touches all three points. when the three points are perfectly collinear, there is no valid circumcircle.

### description
the visualisation demonstrates how to find the circumcircle by hand. first, find the three perpendicular bisectors, and see where they intersect (it is always at one point!). that is the center of the circumcircle!
