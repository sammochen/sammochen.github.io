title: floodfill - breadth-first search
src: ../src/floodfill.js
---


### how to use
click to flood the grid with cool colours! click again and unfill it.

### description
when you press a square, it is as if there is a flood filling the maze and the 'water' spreads across the whole maze. The algorithm behind this is breadth-first search (bfs) and the algorithm discovers the maze layer by layer.
