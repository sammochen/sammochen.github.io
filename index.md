## welcome!

hi! my name is sam, and i've wanted to share little coding projects for a while now, so here goes nothing! 

i am more currently more interested in the algorithmic side of things, but i do also LOVE games and problem solving! i will, hopefully, keep this site nice and stacked with random things that i come up with. 

this is also a personal challenge for me to learn apps-in-web with js, as well as web-design itself, so you may see the website change here and there too.

enjoy!
