## welcome!

hi! i'm sam, and here are some random projects! 

i am more currently more interested in the algorithmic side of things, but i do enjoy games and problem solving! heads up, i am no graphics designer and am not that good on the design end of things.

this is also a personal challenge for me to learn js, as well as web-design itself, so you may see the website change here and there too.

enjoy!
